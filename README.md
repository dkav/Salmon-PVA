# Salmon PVA
R code that can be used to produce a standardised quantitative assessment of European stocks of wild Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*).

This project provides the means to: (1) measure the long-term growth rate and associated risk of decline; (2) compare how those estimates change if they are calculated with data from a more recent time period; (3) measure the long-term growth rate for the two main sea age classes for both time periods; (4) measure the long-term growth rate and associated risk of decline at a regional level for both time periods.

Originally developed as part of Darren Kavanagh's MSc thesis, submitted to National University of Ireland Galway in November 2009.
